## **Detailed summary**

The experience begins with a friendly and intuitive onboarding process. A user arrives on the app, possibly someone who feels unsure about where to start with investing. Instead of presenting them with complicated forms or charts, the assistant begins a conversation. It asks a few straightforward, human-style questions — such as how comfortable they are with risk, what their investment goals are, and what sectors or topics they’re interested in, like green energy, AI, or dividend stocks. Optionally, the user can also input their budget and how long they plan to invest.

These answers form the core of the user’s investment profile. The system now knows not only their financial goals and comfort level with risk but also what they care about. This profile is handed over to a backend system where the real intelligence begins. At this point, two key engines come into play — a large language model like GPT-4 or FinGPT, and live stock market data from Yahoo Finance.

The system queries Yahoo Finance in real time. It collects relevant stock data, including things like valuation metrics, sector trends, analyst ratings, and recent price movement. Meanwhile, the LLM interprets the user’s preferences in natural language and cross-references that with the live market context. It doesn't just pick random stocks. It selects a carefully curated basket that matches the user’s preferences and current trends in the financial world.

For each stock selected, the assistant provides a clear, human-readable explanation. It tells the user why the stock was chosen — how it matches their risk level, why it fits into their chosen themes, and what the potential rewards or risks might be. If the user asked for tech stocks and wanted medium risk with growth potential, they might see companies like NVIDIA or Microsoft along with reasons such as strong AI investments or stable historical performance.

These results are presented visually as well. The assistant shows a pie chart or list of suggested stocks, possibly alongside a simple simulated backtest showing how the basket would have performed over the last year. This adds an extra layer of confidence and learning. The user can download or share the recommendations, but more importantly, they can interact with them.

There’s a feedback loop built in. After showing the portfolio, the assistant checks in and asks whether it feels right. If not, the user can tweak their preferences and regenerate a new set of recommendations. This reassessment loop helps refine results and gives users control over the outcome.

Technically, this process is designed to be fast, intuitive, and secure. The frontend is built with modern web technologies like React or Next.js, with a clean and animated UI powered by Tailwind and Framer Motion. The backend is built in Python or Node.js, handling API requests, caching live data via Redis to avoid unnecessary load, and managing secure interactions with the LLM.

The AI layer is carefully engineered using advanced prompt techniques. It knows how to translate investment goals into relevant financial language and cross-match them with current data. Security and compliance are respected too — all responses come with disclaimers, and nothing is presented as financial advice.

Over time, users can revisit the app to check new suggestions, track their saved portfolios, or simply experiment with different scenarios. The assistant is meant to grow with them, improving their financial literacy while reducing the friction and fear that often comes with starting to invest.

Behind this smooth experience is a powerful but accessible goal: to make investing understandable, personal, and even enjoyable — no spreadsheets or jargon required. Just smart suggestions powered by AI, real-time data, and thoughtful design.
