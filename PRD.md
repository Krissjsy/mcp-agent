# Smart AI Investment Assistant – Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

A smart, AI-powered investment assistant that uses conversational onboarding to assess a user's investment preferences (risk tolerance, goals, interests) and delivers personalized stock basket suggestions. These recommendations are powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) such as FinGPT or GPT-4, combined with live market data from Yahoo Finance.

The assistant is designed to make investing more intuitive, accessible, and educational for everyone – especially retail users without a finance background.

## 2. Objectives

- Simplify retail investing with natural language inputs.
- Offer intelligent, explainable stock suggestions based on live data and user profiles.
- Encourage financial literacy through transparent AI recommendations.
- Provide a fast, intuitive, and jargon-free onboarding and suggestion flow.
